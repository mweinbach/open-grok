# Getting Started

Open Grok is Grok Build with ChatGPT Codex optimizations. It runs as a TUI
(Terminal User Interface) that understands your codebase, executes shell
commands, edits files, searches the web, and manages tasks across xAI and
OpenAI Codex models.

You can use it interactively as a full-screen TUI, run it headlessly for scripting and CI/CD, or integrate it into editors via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).

## Installation

Install the latest Apple Silicon macOS release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mweinbach/open-grok/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Install a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mweinbach/open-grok/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s 0.1.220-open-grok.24
```

The installer writes only `open-grok` under
`${OPENGROK_HOME:-$HOME/.opengrok}/bin`; it does not create or replace `grok`
or `agent` commands. Build from source on other platforms.

Verify the installation:

```bash
open-grok --version
```

Check for or install the latest verified release:

```bash
open-grok update --check
open-grok update --check --json
open-grok update
```

Release builds also check at launch and download an available update in the
background for the next restart. Disable that behavior in Settings, with
`[cli] auto_update = false` in `$OPENGROK_HOME/config.toml`, with the one-launch
`--no-auto-update` flag, or with `OPENGROK_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1`.

---

## First Launch

Start Open Grok by running:

```bash
open-grok
```

On first launch, Open Grok asks whether you want to connect xAI or OpenAI
Codex, then starts the selected sign-in flow. xAI credentials are stored in
`~/.opengrok/auth.json`; Codex credentials are stored separately in
`~/.opengrok/codex-auth.json`. Both paths follow `OPENGROK_HOME`, and neither
touches an upstream `~/.grok` installation.

If you prefer API key authentication (e.g., for CI/CD or environments without a browser), set the `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable instead:

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="xai-..."
open-grok
```

See [Authentication](02-authentication.md) for the full set of auth options including OIDC, external auth providers, and device code flow.

---

## Basic Interaction

Once authenticated, Open Grok presents a full-screen TUI with two main areas:

- **Scrollback** -- the conversation history showing your prompts, model responses, tool calls, file edits, and more.
- **Prompt** -- the input area at the bottom where you type messages.

Type a message and press `Enter` to send it. Grok reads files, runs commands, and edits code as needed. Each tool run streams into the scrollback in real time.

Press `Tab` to move focus between the prompt and the scrollback. While a turn is running, `Esc` cancels it (the exception is fullscreen vim scrollback mode, where mid-turn `Esc` is a no-op; minimal mode cancels even with vim on); `Ctrl+C` cancels once the composer is empty — with a draft, the first press only clears it. Idle, press `Esc` twice within 800ms to clear a non-empty prompt, or (with an empty prompt and conversation messages) to open rewind — see [Keyboard Shortcuts](03-keyboard-shortcuts.md#escape). With the scrollback focused, use the arrow keys to select entries and to collapse or expand them. To navigate with `j`/`k` and fold with `h`/`l` instead, enable Vim mode.

### File References

Use `@` in your prompt to attach files:

```
@src/main.rs              # Attach a file
@src/main.rs:10-50        # Attach lines 10-50
@src/                     # Browse a directory
```

The `@` operator opens a fuzzy file picker. By default it respects `.gitignore` and hides dotfiles. Prefix with `!` to search hidden files:

```
@!.github                 # Search hidden files
@!.env                    # Attach a .env file
```

### Permissions

By default, Grok asks for permission before executing shell commands or editing files. You can approve individually or toggle always-approve mode:

- Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle always-approve mode
- Use the `--yolo` flag at launch: `open-grok --yolo`
- Type `/always-approve` in the prompt to toggle the mode

---

## Key Concepts

### Sessions

Every conversation is a **session**. Sessions are automatically saved to `~/.opengrok/sessions/` and can be resumed later. Each session tracks the full conversation history, tool calls, file edits, and task state.

- Start a new session: `Ctrl+N` or `/new`
- Resume a previous session: `/resume` in the TUI, or `--resume <ID>` from the CLI
- Continue the most recent session: `open-grok -c`

### Scrollback

The scrollback is the main display area. It shows:

- **User prompts** -- your messages, rendered as sticky headers
- **Agent messages** -- Grok's responses with full markdown rendering and syntax highlighting
- **Thinking blocks** -- Grok's reasoning process (collapsible)
- **Tool calls** -- file edits (with inline diffs), command executions, search results, and more
- **Task lists** -- TODO items tracking progress

Collapse or expand the selected entry with the `Left`/`Right` arrow keys (or `h`/`l` and `e` in Vim mode). In Vim mode, press `y` to copy its content and `Y` to copy its metadata (for example, the command that ran). Press `Enter` to open it in the fullscreen viewer (in any mode).

### Tools

Grok has built-in tools for:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` / `search_replace` | Read and edit files with line-precise changes |
| `grep` | Regex search across your codebase (powered by ripgrep) |
| `list_dir` | List directory contents |
| `run_terminal_command` | Execute shell commands |
| `web_search` / `web_fetch` | Search the web and fetch URLs |
| `todo_write` | Create and manage task lists |
| `spawn_subagent` | Spawn parallel subagent sessions |
| `memory_search` | Search cross-session memory |

Tools can be extended with [MCP servers](05-configuration.md#mcp-servers) for integrations like GitHub, databases, and more.

### Slash Commands

Type `/` in the prompt to access commands. These provide quick actions without writing a full prompt:

```
/model grok-build                 # Switch model
/compact                          # Compress conversation history
/always-approve                   # Toggle always-approve mode
/new                              # Start a new session
```

See [Slash Commands](04-slash-commands.md) for the complete reference.

## Common Launch Options

```bash
# Launch the interactive TUI and submit an initial prompt as the first turn
open-grok "fix the failing auth test and run it"

# Initial prompt in a new git worktree. Use --worktree=<name> (with `=`) so the
# prompt isn't swallowed as the worktree name — `open-grok -w "refactor module X"`
# would treat "refactor module X" as the worktree label, not the prompt.
open-grok --worktree=feat "refactor module X"

# Base the worktree on a specific branch (e.g. main) instead of the current HEAD:
open-grok -w --ref main "implement feature from main"


# Start in a specific project directory
open-grok --cwd ~/projects/my-app

# Add project-specific rules
open-grok --rules "Always use TypeScript. Prefer functional components."

# Auto-approve all tool executions
open-grok --yolo

# Use a specific model
open-grok -m grok-build

# Resume a previous session
open-grok --resume <session-id>

# Continue the most recent session
open-grok -c

# Experimental scrollback-native render mode. Sticky: plain `open-grok` reopens in
# the mode last chosen via --minimal/--fullscreen (or /minimal//fullscreen).
open-grok --minimal

# Back to the standard fullscreen TUI (and make it sticky again)
open-grok --fullscreen

# Headless mode (for scripts)
open-grok -p "Explain this codebase"
```

---

## Headless Mode

Run Grok non-interactively for scripting, CI/CD, and automation:

```bash
open-grok -p "Your prompt here"
```

Output formats:

| Format | Flag | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `plain` | (default) | Human-readable text |
| `json` | `--output-format json` | Single JSON object with `text`, `stopReason`, `sessionId`, and `requestId` |
| `streaming-json` | `--output-format streaming-json` | NDJSON event stream for real-time processing |

Example CI/CD usage:

```bash
open-grok -p "Review changes for bugs" --output-format json --yolo | jq -r '.text'
```

---

## Project Rules (AGENTS.md)

Add per-project instructions by creating an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository. Grok reads these files and injects their contents as a project-instructions message at the start of the conversation:

```
~/.opengrok/AGENTS.md           # Global rules (apply to all projects)
<repo-root>/AGENTS.md       # Repository-level rules
<cwd>/AGENTS.md             # Directory-level rules (highest priority)
```

Deeper files take precedence. Grok also reads `CLAUDE.md` files for compatibility.
